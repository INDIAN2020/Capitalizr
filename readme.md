This is a simple WordPress utility plugin that will auto-update the title, h2, and h3 tags of
a post when it is saved to the database. It ensures that words are correctly
capitalized (or lowercased). 

For instance, "This Is My Awesome javascript post" will be updated to "This is My Awesome JavaScript Post".
